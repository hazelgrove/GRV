## Comments

- Multi-parent example does not give information on how to fix the conflict
- The UUIDs are inconsistent between the paper and the impl
- Restore has too many steps
- Unicyles are wreaths
- Need to figure out what the editor actions are supposed to do

---

## TODOs

- Rename `wreath` to `unicyle`
- Make the restore action smoother
- Cut/copy/paste would be nice
